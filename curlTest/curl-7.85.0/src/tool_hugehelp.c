"\n"
"SYNOPSIS\n"
"       curl [options / URLs]\n"
"\n"
"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       curl  is  a tool for transferring data from or to a server. It supports\n"
"       these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS,  HTTP,  HTTPS,\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       IMAP,  IMAPS,  LDAP,  LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP,\n"
"       SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET or TFTP. The command  is  designed\n"
"       to work without user interaction.\n"
"\n"
"       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-\n"
"       tication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file  trans-\n"
"       fer resume and more. As you will see below, the number of features will\n"
"       make your head spin.\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See\n"
"       libcurl(3) for details.\n"
"\n"
"URL\n"
"       The  URL  syntax is protocol-dependent. You find a detailed description\n"
"       in RFC 3986.\n"
"\n"
"       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets\n"
"       within braces and quoting the URL as in:\n"
"\n"
"         \"http://site.{one,two,three}.com\"\n"
"\n"
"       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"         \"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt\"\n"
"\n"
"         \"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt\"    (with leading zeros)\n"
"\n"
"         \"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt\"\n"
"\n"
"       Nested  sequences  are not supported, but you can use several ones next\n"
"       to each other:\n"
"\n"
"         \"http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html\"\n"
"\n"
"       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.  They  will  be\n"
, stdout);

"       fetched  in a sequential manner in the specified order. You can specify\n"
"       command line options and URLs mixed and in any  order  on  the  command\n"

"\n"
"       You  can  specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"       When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line  prompt,\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the\n"
"       shell from interfering with it. This also  goes  for  other  characters\n"
"       treated special, like for example '&', '?' and '*'.\n"
"\n"
"       Provide  the IPv6 zone index in the URL with an escaped percentage sign\n"

"       try other protocols based on often-used host name prefixes.  For  exam-\n"
"       ple,  for  host names starting with \"ftp.\" curl will assume you want to\n"
"       speak FTP.\n"
"\n"
"       curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL.  It  is  not\n"

"       files  specified  on  a  single command line and cannot be used between\n"

"OUTPUT\n"
